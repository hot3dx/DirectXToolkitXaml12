#All files renamed ...Xaml12 so as not to conflict with the DirectXTK12 of Chuck Walburn
#12/31/2020 
#Happy New Year's present 

The Front Code of AppXamlDX12 other than that in the Graphics folder
can easily be used to create a DirectX 12 Xaml UWP App because this 
library contains all the files in that directory.

# Nice part: the DirectXToolkitXaml12 library only needs to occupy one 
## folder and all your apps code can link to it!
# Use C:\DirectXToolKitXaml12
for zero problems with App1 sample
