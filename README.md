# DirectXToolkitXaml12

## The DirectXToolkitXaml12 is a DirectX 12 Toolkit Xaml Library

The Front Code of AppXamlDX12 other than that in the Graphics folder
can easily be used to create a DirectX 12 Xaml UWP App because this 
library contains all the files in that directory.

Nice part: the DirectXToolkitXaml12 library only needs to occupy one 
folder and all your apps code can link to it!
